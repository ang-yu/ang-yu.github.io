Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a popular tool for estimating the causal effect of a binary treatment variable under the conditional ignorability assumption. There are multiple variants of the IPW estimator. I used to be intrigued by the relationship between the so-called Horvitz–Thompson estimator and the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimator, both of which implement IPW.
