(Unfinished)

It has been commonly argued in sociology that odds ratio-as a measure of association between categorical variables-is appealing, because of its ``margin-free" property. The margin-free thing has always baffled me, so I decided to explicate my bafflement here as a sanity check. 

To begin with, here's my understanding of what people are really trying to do when they use a "margin-free" measure. The idea is to separate absolute/marginal/uniform/across-the-board changes in the marginal distribution from (relative) changes in the disparity/association (e.g., Mare, 1981). Now how does odds ratio achieve this? It does so in terms of cell or joint probabilities.

Consider a simple two-by-two table, where the dependent variable is a binary indicator of college graduation, and the independent variable is a binary SES indicator. Then the odds ratio is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \left. \frac{Pr(college=1 | SES=high)}{Pr(college=0 | SES=high)} \middle/ \frac{Pr(college=1 | SES=low)}{Pr(college=0 | SES=low)} \right.,
\end{equation}
which can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\left. \frac{Pr(college=1, SES=high)}{Pr(college=0, SES=high)} \middle/ \frac{Pr(college=1, SES=low)}{Pr(college=0, SES=low)} \right..
\end{equation}

So expression (1) is in terms of conditional probabilities, and expression (2) is in terms of joint probabilities (or equivalently, cell probabilities, referring to cells of the 2-by-2 table). And odds ratio is margin-free in the sense that if we multiply both $Pr(college=1, SES=high)$ and $Pr(college=1, SES=low)$ by an $u$, and correspondingly multiply $Pr(college=0, SES=high)$ and $Pr(college=0, SES=low)$ by $v=\frac{1-\alpha[Pr(college=1, SES=high)+Pr(college=1, SES=low)]}{Pr(college=0, SES=high) + Pr(college=0, SES=low)}$, then the odds ratio remains unchanged (the value of $v$ is such so that the the four joint probabilities still sum to 1). Note that this logic only works on exression (2), not expression (1), due to the constraint that $Pr(college=1 \mid SES=high)+Pr(college=0 \mid SES=high)=1$ and $Pr(college=1 \mid SES=low)+Pr(college=0 \mid SES=low)=1$. And this is exactly why I find the margin-free property of odds ratio not that appealling, i.e., to me, the joint probabilities and changes defined in terms of them are substantively less natural and less relevant. 

I think joint probabilities are less natural than conditional probabilities for two reasons. First, in practice, basically all statistical models used in sociology are formulated for conditional probabilities. For example, in a linear setting, our model is $Pr(college=1 \mid SES)=\alpha + \beta SES$ and in a logit setting, the model is $Pr(college=1 \mid SES) = invlogit(\alpha + \beta SES)$. I think this dovetails well with how we think about disparities, i.e., we think about probabilities of college graduation and how it varies by SES, not the probability of being in a cell jointly defined by graduation status and SES.
