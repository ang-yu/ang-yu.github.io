Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a popular tool for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) of a binary variable under the conditional ignorability assumption. There are multiple variants of IPW. Particularly, I used to be intrigued by the relationship between the so-called Horvitz–Thompson (HT) estimator and the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimator, both of which implement IPW. Both estimators are introduced in popular causal inference textbooks. For example, Angrist and Pischke (2009, p.82) focus on the HT estimator, while Winship and Morgan (2014, p228-9) focus on the WLS estimator. However, I haven't seen them introduced together in these textbooks, and their relationship could seem a little confusing. In fact, a quick simulation would reveal that the classic version of the HT estimator gives a different ATE estimate from that given by the WLS estimator in any given (finite) sample. 

As it turns out, the WLS estimator exactly coincides with a "stablized" version of the HT estimator. Let $Y$ be the outcome, $T$ be a binary treatment, and $\pi=E(T \mid X)$ be the propensity score defined in terms of covariates $X$. Then the stablized HT estimator for ATE is 
<p style="text-align: center;">$$ \frac{ \sum  \frac{T_i}{\pi_i} Y_i }{  \sum \frac{T_i}{\pi_i} } - \frac{ \sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i} Y_i}{ \sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i}}. $$</p>
The classic HT estimator is just (1) without the denominators. The stablized HT estimator is also called the Hajek estimator and the normalized HT estimator. And the WLS estimator for ATE is the second element of the 1-by-2 vector $(\boldsymbol{T}'\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{T})^{-1}\boldsymbol{T}'\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{Y}$, where $\boldsymbol{T}$ is a n-by-2 matrix, where the first column is a vector of 1’s and the second is the variable $T$, $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a n-by-n diagonal matrix where the $i$-th element is $W_i=\frac{T_i}{\pi_i}+\frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i}$, and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ is an 1-by-n vector of the variable $Y$. The equivalence between the stablized HT estimator and the WLS estimator was briefly mentioned in Freeman and Berk (2008, p.406). To demstify this eqivalence, I offer a proof of it in this post, which is unsurprisingly quite short.

&=\frac{1}{\sum\frac{T_i}{\pi_i} \sum\frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i}} 
\begin{pmatrix}

\sum \frac{T_i}{\pi_i} Y_i \sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i} - \sum \frac{T_i}{\pi_i} \sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i} Y_i

\begin{pmatrix}

\frac{\sum \frac{T_i}{\pi_i} Y_i }{\sum \frac{T_i}{\pi_i}} - \frac{\sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i} Y_i}{\sum \frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i} }. 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
Hence, this equivalence is established simply by re-writting the WLS estimator in matrix notation.
