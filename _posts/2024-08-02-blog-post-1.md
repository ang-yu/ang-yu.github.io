(work in progress)

I recently found myself reading the large methodological literature on logit models in sociology again. And I think I found a way to explain some phenomena of logit models that's easier to understand (at least to myself) than the explanations in the prior literature. I'll try it here in a blog before (maybe, one day) attempting to systematically write up a paper. 

<h1> The functional form assumption of logit models </h1>
I feel it's worth it to write out the basic assumption for logit models. For a logit model to estimate something interpretable, a functional form assumption on the conditional probability $Pro(Y=1 \mid X)$ is needed:
\begin{equation}
 Pr(Y=1 \mid X)=\frac{\exp(\alpha+\betaX)}{1+\exp(\alpha+\betaX)}.
\end{equation}
