(work in progress)

I recently found myself reading the large methodological literature on logit models in sociology again. And I think I found a way to explain some phenomena of logit models that's easier to understand (at least to myself) than the explanations in the prior literature. I'll try it here in a blog before (maybe, one day) attempting to systematically write up a paper. 

<h1> The functional form assumption of logit models </h1>
I feel it's worth it to write out the basic assumption for logit models first. For a logit model to estimate something interpretable, a functional form assumption on the conditional probability $Pro(Y=1 \mid X)$ is needed:
\begin{equation}
 Pr(Y=1 \mid X)=\frac{\exp(\alpha+\beta X)}{1+\exp(\alpha+\beta X)}.
\end{equation}

Given this assumption, using a logit model to regress $Y$ on $X$ will give you consistent estimates of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
  
<h1> Why do nested logits cause problems </h1>
Simple answer: because you (the researcher) are making self-contradictory assumptions! In two nested logit models, the researcher first use logit to regress $Y$ on $X1$, then again use logit to regress $Y$ on $X1$ and $X2$ at the same time. But to do this, the researcher has to assume that $Pr(Y=1 \mid X1)=\frac{\exp(\alpha+\beta X1)}{1+\exp(\alpha+\beta X1)}$ and $Pr(Y=1 \mid X1, X2)=\frac{\exp(\alpha+\beta 1 X1 + \beta 2 X2)}{1+\exp(\alpha+\beta 1 X1 + \beta 2 X2)}$. But this is generally impossible, because $Pr(Y=1 \mid X1)=E[Pr(Y=1 \mid X1, X2) \mid X1]$.

<h1> Are logits biased if there's any unmodelled variation in $Y$? </h1>
