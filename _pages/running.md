I started running in summer 2022 and have reaped huge physical and psychological benefits from it. I've run a couple of races this year, and here are my results. 

| Date        | Place   | Race                   | Distance        |  Time   | Pace (per mile) | 
| --------    | ------  | ------------------     | ------          | ------- | --------------- |
| Sep 2023    | Madison | UW Grad School Dash and Bash      |  5.07 mile             | 36:14   | 7:09            |
| Aug 2023    | Madison | Madison Mini Marathorn |  Half Marathorn | 1:41:12 | 7:44            |

My next race will be a half marathorn in Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon in October!
