I am a fourth-year PhD student in sociology at UW-Madison. I also obatined an Master's degree in statitiscs from the same university. I am interested in developing and applying statistically rigorious tools to address social inequalities. In particular, my methodological interests are in causal inference and nonparametric statitiscs. And my substantive interests are in social stratification and mobility, sociology of education, and health disparities.
