I recently received my PhD in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Currently, I work as a research scientist on Meta's Demography and Survey Science team in Menlo Park, CA. I continue to work on social science methodology, particularly at the intersection between causal inference and machine learning.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and also hold a master's degree in statistics from the same university. I am interested in developing and applying rigorous and impactful tools in statistics. My methodological interests lie in causal inference, particularly mediation/longitudinal estimands and causal machine learning. My substantive areas include social stratification and mobility, sociology of education, and health disparity. -->
