I am a PhD candidate in sociology at UW-Madison. I also obtained a master's degree in statistics from the same university. I am interested in developing and applying statistically rigorous tools to address social inequalities. In particular, my methodological interests are in causal inference and nonparametric statistics. And my substantive interests are in social stratification and mobility, sociology of education, and health disparities.
