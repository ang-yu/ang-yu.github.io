I am a fourth-year PhD student in sociology at UW-Madison. I also obatin an Master's degree in statitiscs from the same university. My interest lies at the intersection of sociology and statistics. In particular, I develop tools of causal inference and nonparametric statitiscs and apply them to study SES and racial inequalities in income, education, health, etc.
