I am an Assitant Professor in the Division of Social Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

I work on social science methodology, particularly at the intersection between causal inference and machine learning. 

My workflow often involves two steps. First, I translate substantive questions into formal estimands. Second, I develop statistical estimators with good properties for the estimands.
