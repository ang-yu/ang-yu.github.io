I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and also hold a master's degree in statistics from the same university. I am interested in developing and applying rigorous and impactful tools in statistics. My methodological interests lie in causal inference, particularly mediation/longitudinal estimands and causal machine learning. My substantive areas of focus include social stratification and mobility, the sociology of education, and health disparities.
